A lead is a person or a company that is interested in your products or services. Record leads before they buy. When a lead becomes a customer, make a customer from the lead.

## Turn On Leads

1. Click **Setup** > **Settings** in the sidebar.
2. In the **General** tab, turn on **Enable Lead**.
3. Click **Save** and click **Yes** to reload Frappe Books.

**Lead** now shows in the **Sales** group of the sidebar. You cannot turn off leads after you save the setting.

## Create a Lead

1. Click **Sales** > **Lead** in the sidebar.
2. Click **New**.
3. Enter the **Name** of the lead. Each lead must have a different name.
4. Optional: Enter the **Email**, the **Mobile**, and the **Address**.
5. Click **Save**.

A Books User can create, edit, and delete leads. For more information, see [Roles and Permissions](/books/roles-and-permissions).

## Lead Status

A new lead starts as **Open**. Change the **Status** as you work with the lead: **Replied**, **Interested**, **Opportunity**, **Quotation**, **Converted**, or **Do not Contact**. Frappe Books also changes the status for some actions:

- When you submit a sales quote to the lead, the status changes to **Quotation**.
- When you save a customer that you made from the lead, the status changes to **Converted**.
- When you delete that customer, the status changes back to **Interested**.

## Create a Customer From a Lead

1. Open the lead.
2. Click **Create** > **Customer** in the page header.
3. Check the details of the new customer. If a party with the same name exists, change the **Name**.
4. Click **Save**.

The new customer gets the name, the email, the address, and the mobile number of the lead. The mobile number goes to the **Phone** field. The **From Lead** field shows the lead. For more information, see [Party](/books/party).

## Create a Sales Quote for a Lead

1. Open the lead.
2. Click **Create** > **Sales Quote** in the page header.
3. Add the items.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Click **Submit** and click **Yes**.

You cannot make a sales invoice from a quote to a lead. First create a customer from the lead. Then make the sales invoice for the customer. For more information, see [Sales Quotes](/books/sales-quotes).
