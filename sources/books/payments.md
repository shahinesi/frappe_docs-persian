A payment records money that moves between you and a party. When you submit a payment, Frappe Books makes the ledger entries and decreases the outstanding amount of the invoices that the payment settles.

## Payment Types

| Payment Type | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Receive | A customer pays you, or a supplier refunds a purchase return. |
| Pay | You pay a supplier, or you refund a sales return to a customer. |

The labels of the account fields change with the **Payment Type**. **From Account** always shows the account that the money comes from.

## Making Payments from Invoices

1. Open a submitted sales invoice or purchase invoice that has an outstanding amount.
2. Click **Create** > **Payment**.
3. Check the **Payment Method** and the cash or bank account.
4. If the payment method is not **Cash**, enter the **Ref. / Cheque No.**
5. Click **Save**.
6. Click **Submit** and click **Yes**.

Frappe Books fills the party, the payment type, the **Amount**, and a reference to the invoice. The amount is the outstanding amount of the invoice. The cash or bank account is the **Sales Payment Account** or the **Purchase Payment Account** in the **Defaults** settings. If that account is not set, it is the account of the **Cash** payment method.

## Making Payments from the Payments List

Use this way for a payment that settles more than one invoice, or a payment without an invoice.

1. Click **Sales** > **Sales Payments** or **Purchases** > **Purchase Payments** in the sidebar.
2. Click **New**.
3. Select the **Party**. Frappe Books fills the **Payment Type** and the party account.
4. Select the **Payment Method**, and check the cash or bank account.
5. In **Payment Reference**, add one row for each invoice that the payment settles. In each row, select the **Type** and the invoice in **Name**.
6. Check the **Amount** of the payment.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Click **Submit** and click **Yes**.

A payment for a sales invoice shows in **Sales Payments**, and a payment for a purchase invoice shows in **Purchase Payments**. A payment without an invoice shows in **Sales Payments** for the type **Receive**, and in **Purchase Payments** for the type **Pay**.

### Payment Reference Rules

- The invoice must be submitted and must belong to the party of the payment.
- The amount of a row cannot be more than the outstanding amount of the invoice.
- The total of the rows cannot be more than the **Amount** of the payment.

To pay less than the outstanding amount, turn on **Enable Partial Payment** in the **General** settings. The invoice then shows the **Partly Paid** status. A payment without references, such as an advance, does not change the outstanding amount of an invoice.

## Payment Methods

Frappe Books adds two payment methods: **Cash** and **Bank**. Each method has a **Type** (**Cash**, **Bank**, or **Transfer**) and an **Account**. When you change the **Payment Method** of a payment, Frappe Books changes the cash or bank account too.

- For the **Bank** and **Transfer** types, you must enter the **Ref. / Cheque No.**
- If the method has **Requires Clearance Date** selected, you must enter the **Clearance Date**.

To add a payment method, search for `Payment Method` in [Quick Search](/books/quick-search). Only a **Books Manager** or a **System Manager** can add or edit payment methods.

## Write Off

**Write Off** is a part of the amount that you do not receive or pay, such as a bank charge. The write-off goes to the **Write Off Account** in the **General** settings.

For example, an invoice has an outstanding amount of 1,000, and the customer pays 990. Enter `1000` in **Amount** and `10` in **Write Off**. **Amount Paid** shows 990, and the invoice becomes **Paid**.

## Taxes and Currency

If a tax template row has a **Tax Payment Account**, a payment moves the paid part of that tax to this account. See [Taxes](/books/taxes). Payments are always in the company currency. See [Multi Currency Invoicing](/books/multi-currency-invoicing).

## Cancelling a Payment

When you cancel a payment, Frappe Books reverses the ledger entries of the payment and adds its amounts back to the outstanding amounts of its invoices. When you cancel an invoice, Frappe Books also cancels the payments that settle it.
